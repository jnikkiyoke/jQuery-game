# jQuery-game
### A simple car racing animation created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the jQuery library.

The cars begin on the far left of the screen- pressing the "start" button initiates the script, and the cars move
across the screen at varying speeds (each time the script runs, the cars travel at different speeds, using the Math.random function).

Once the first car has completed the race, the scoreboard prints the which car came in first/second place, and the time it took to
cross the screen.

Pretty cool!

*NOTE: there is currently an issue with the road image appearing behind the cars in the live version on GitHub. I am working to resolve this.*
